Custom Item Requests
2129 - Pocket Protector (Battalion's Backup with different Rage mechanic: Build rage by gaining health from medics. Unleash Rage for minicrits, but buff causes inability to gain health from medics for duration of buff).
2141 - The Texas Ten-Shot (Frontier Justice mod: 10 shots, damage buff for each consecutive shot, more max ammo, very slow reload, also has a domination symbol thing near its muzzle)
2161 - Texan Love (Big Kill mod, but meant for engy secondary: Faster shooting and more accurate, hopefully can shoot sappers off buildings with a full clip, but slow reload and heals slower)
2127 - Some special direct hit a friend requested: 2 shot clip, fast shots like the Direct Hit, extra damage like the DH, minicrits airborne targets like the DH, increased damage taken from bullets like the Pain Train
2159 - A testing Dalokohs Bar weapon I added to see if I could make other classes have temporary +50 max health. It *sorta* works right, but it's more of a testing item, so avoid.
2433 - Same as above, but for the Fishcake
2228 - The Army of One: A special type of Black Box that I saw on a YouTube video (used the Direct Hit model in it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0wg0PvP0zg#t=3m58s)
2009 - A shotgun that uses the Frontier Justice Model but with normal attributes, since the normal shotguns are buggy. Primary Shotty.
2193 - Fighter's Falcata. Faster fire rate, more damage, but -15 hp when you hit somebody.
2171 - Khopesh Climber. Climb walls by whacking them! Thanks to Mecha the Slag.
2197 - Rebel's Curse. It's a wrench. A glowy purple wrench. IT DISSOLVES THINGS.
2058 - a Jar of Ants
9266 - Horsemann's OP Headtaker- makes you like the Horsemann!
5142 - Golden Gunslinger
