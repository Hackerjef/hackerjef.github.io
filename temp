There are 2 kinds of people, those who know they're using G+, and those who don't know they're using G+.
Now you can close your eyes, and squeeze your fists, and clench your anus really tight and say BUTIMNOTUSINGGOOGLEPLUSIAMFACEBOOKFORLIVEILOVEMARKZ and it doesn't fucking matter, if you have a Google/Gmail/Youtube/Picassa account you have a Google+ account and if you use any of those services with a minimum of regularity then you my friend are a Google+ user, even if you never actually touch the URL at plus.google.com.
It's being integrated accross Google's other services, a couple years from now it'll be ubiquitous, and I will bet you anything that Android's answer to iOS' Game Center will also be tied to G+ in some way.
So relax and let it happen.
